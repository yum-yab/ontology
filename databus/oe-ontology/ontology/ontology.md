# The Open Energy Ontology
The Open Energy Ontology is an ontology for all aspects of the energy modelling domain. 

It is developed in three modules: 'oeo-model', a module for all entities related to models and modelling; 'oeo-physical', a module for all entities related to the world of energy and energy generation, and 'oeo-social' for all relevant social and economic aspects of the energy domain.
